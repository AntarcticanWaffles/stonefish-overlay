My personal gentoo overlay, still learning to write ebuilds...
Now slightly less unstable, as I test ebuilds locally now... as you should.

FEATURING:
Stegsnow, a program occasionally seen in ctfs.
PGO enabled python, taken from lto-overlay and rebased to current gentoo ebuilds.
The latest version of kakoune
